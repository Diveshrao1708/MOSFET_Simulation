# MOSFET_Simulation

## Overview
This project provides a simulation of MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) behavior using computational models. It aims to help understand the characteristics and performance of MOSFET devices under different operating conditions.

## Features
- Simulation of MOSFET characteristics such as IV curves and transfer characteristics
- Support for different MOSFET models (e.g., NMOS, PMOS)
- Graphical visualization of results
- Customizable input parameters for circuit analysis

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Diveshrao1708/MOSFET_Simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MOSFET_Simulation
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the simulation script:
```bash
python simulate.py
```
Modify input parameters within the script to test different MOSFET configurations.
